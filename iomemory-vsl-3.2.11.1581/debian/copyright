	 IMPORTANT - PLEASE READ CAREFULLY BEFORE INSTALLING OR USING THIS SOFTWARE PRODUCT.  This end-user license agreement ("EULA") is a legal agreement between you (either an individual or the entity you represent) ("you") and SanDisk Corporation ("SanDisk") that governs your use of the generally available SanDisk software product, user guide, and any related utilities and user documentation (collectively, the "Software"); your use of a beta release of a SanDisk software product, user guide, and any related utilities and user documentation (collectively, "Beta Software"); and your use of any SanDisk software development kit and related user documentation (collectively "SDK File").  The Software, Beta Software, and SDK Files are interchangeably referred to in this EULA as the "Product."

	RIGHTS IN THE PRODUCT ARE OFFERED ONLY ON THE CONDITION THAT YOU AGREE TO ALL TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS EULA.  BY INSTALLING, COPYING, DOWNLOADING, OR OTHERWISE USING THE PRODUCT, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THIS EULA.  IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THIS AGREEMENT, DO NOT INSTALL, DOWNLOAD, OR OTHERWISE USE THE PRODUCT.

	1. LICENSE TO THE PRODUCT.  Subject to the restrictions set forth in this EULA, SanDisk grants you a non-sub-licensable, nontransferable, nonexclusive, limited license during the term of this EULA to:  (a) use one copy of the Software or Beta Software in connection with the SanDisk hardware product that corresponds with the Software or Beta Software and; (b)  make a single copy of the Software or Beta Software for backup or archival purposes only, as long as the copy contains all of the original proprietary notices; and (c) use one copy of the SDK File as permitted in Section 19 of this EULA below and make a single copy of the SDK File for backup or archival purposes only, as long as the copy contains all of the original proprietary notices.

	2. RESTRICTIONS ON USE.  Except as expressly permitted under this EULA, you may not modify the Product or disable any licensing or control feature of the Product.  You may not rent, lease, sublicense, sell, assign, loan, or otherwise transfer the Product or any of your rights and obligations under this EULA.  You may not remove or destroy any copyright notices or other proprietary markings from the Product.  Except to the extent expressly permitted by applicable law or as expressly permitted under this EULA, you may not alter, modify, adapt, reverse-engineer, disassemble, or decompile the Product, merge the Product into another program, or create derivative works based on the Product.  You may not modify, alter, or change the configuration parameters of the Product to deviate from SanDisk's published configuration parameter settings.  You may not use the Product to develop any product having the same primary function as the Product.  Additional restrictions on use may appear in the user documentation. 

	3. THIRD PARTY USE.  The Product may contain or be distributed with third party software covered by an open source software license ("Open Source Software") or software covered by a license other than the one granted by this EULA ("Third Party Software").  If Open Source Software is included, the terms and conditions of this license do not apply to the Open Source Software.  If Third Party Software is included, the terms and conditions of this license may not apply to Third Party Software.  Information concerning the inclusion of Open Source Software and Third Party Software, if any, and the notices, license terms, and disclaimers applicable to that software are generally contained in a corresponding license file identified with file names such as "notice," "license," "license.txt," "readme," "readme.txt," or "copying".  You should contact SanDisk support if you cannot locate the Open Source Software or Third Party Software licenses for the Product.  If, in a notice file, SanDisk identifies code as "Modifiable Code", SanDisk authorizes you to a) modify the Modifiable Code, and b) reverse engineer the Product modules that directly interface with the Modifiable Code, provided you do so only for the purpose of debugging your modifications to the Modifiable Code.  If the Open Source Software licenses include a license that provides for the availability of source code (e.g., the GNU General Public License) and the corresponding source code is not included with the Product, check SanDisk's product support pages to learn how to obtain such source code.

	4. RESERVATION OF RIGHTS.  The licenses granted to you under this EULA are not a transfer or sale of SanDisk's or its suppliers' ownership rights in or to the Product.  Except for the licenses expressly granted under this EULA, SanDisk and its suppliers retain all right, title, and interest (including all intellectual property rights) in and to the Product.  The Product is protected by applicable intellectual property laws, including United States patent and copyright laws and international property laws and treaties.  SanDisk and its suppliers reserve all rights not expressly granted to you in this EULA.

	5. FEEDBACK.  If SanDisk has provided you with Beta Software or has granted you an Evaluation License under Section 20, your use of the Product is subject to the additional terms contained in this Section 5. To help SanDisk prepare the Beta Software for commercial release, SanDisk is providing you with access to a copy of the Beta Software so that you can test and evaluate the Beta Software and provide feedback concerning the Beta Software, including identifying potential errors and improvements ("Feedback").  If this EULA grants you an Evaluation License, you may be required to provide such Feedback to SanDisk under the terms of your evaluation agreement.  SanDisk will own all right, title, and interest in and to any Feedback you provide, and you hereby assign all of your rights in the Feedback to SanDisk.  SanDisk may use the Feedback, free of charge, without obtaining your consent.

	6. CONFIDENTIALITY.  You will maintain the confidentiality of and not disclose to any third party: (a) all non-public information disclosed by SanDisk to you under this EULA and (b) all Feedback, benchmark and performance data, and other information obtained through your use, testing and evaluation of the Software or Beta Software.

	7. LIMITED WARRANTY AND DISCLAIMER.  SanDisk warrants that, for a period of 90 days from the date the Software is first installed, when used with a recommended hardware configuration, the Software will perform in substantial conformance with the documentation supplied with the Software.  SOFTWARE GOVERNED BY AN EVALUATION LICENSE, BETA SOFTWARE, AND SDK FILES ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND SANDISK DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES AND REPRESENTATIONS WITH REGARD TO SUCH PRODUCTS.  EXCEPT AS SET FORTH IN THE FOREGOING LIMITED WARRANTY, SANDISK AND ITS SUPPLIERS DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES AND REPRESENTATIONS, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, QUALITY, ACCURACY, TITLE, QUIET ENJOYMENT, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. SANDISK DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE PRODUCT IS ERROR-FREE OR THAT THE PRODUCT WILL OPERATE WITHOUT INTERRUPTION.  THE PRODUCT IS NOT DESIGNED, INTENDED OR LICENSED FOR USE IN HAZARDOUS ENVIRONMENTS REQUIRING FAIL-SAFE CONTROLS, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE DESIGN, CONSTRUCTION, MAINTENANCE OR OPERATION OF NUCLEAR FACILITIES, AIRCRAFT NAVIGATION OR COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS, AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL, AND LIFE SUPPORT OR WEAPONS SYSTEMS.  SANDISK SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTY OF FITNESS FOR SUCH PURPOSES.

	8. UPGRADES.  To use software provided by SanDisk as an upgrade, update, or supplement (collectively "Upgrade"), you must first be licensed for the original Product identified by SanDisk as eligible for the Upgrade. To the extent the Upgrade supersedes the original Product, you may no longer use such Product. This EULA applies to each Upgrade unless SanDisk provides other terms with the Upgrade.  In case of a conflict between this EULA and such other terms, the other terms will prevail.

	9. CONSENT TO USE OF DATA. SanDisk may collect technical information relating to your use of Products.  You grant SanDisk and its contractors a perpetual, irrevocable right to use and disclose non-identifiable information relating to your use of the Products, as long as any disclosed information does not include a key or other mechanism that would enable the information to be re-identified.

	10. AUDIT.  You agree that SanDisk may audit your use of the Product for compliance with these terms at any time, upon reasonable notice.  If such an audit reveals any use of the Product by you other than in full compliance with the terms of this EULA, you will reimburse SanDisk for all reasonable expenses related to such audit in addition to any other liabilities you may incur as a result of such non-compliance.

	11. TERMINATION.

Upon termination of this EULA, at SanDisk's request, you will certify in writing to SanDisk that all instances and copies of the Product, or any portion thereof, have either been returned to SanDisk or otherwise destroyed or deleted from any of your computers or storage devices.  SanDisk's rights and your obligations will survive the termination of this EULA.

	12. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.  Notwithstanding any damages that you might incur, the entire liability of SanDisk and its suppliers under this EULA and your exclusive remedy under this EULA will be limited to the greater of the amount actually paid by you for the Product, or U.S. $50.00.  TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL SANDISK OR ITS SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOST DATA, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, PERSONAL INJURY, OR LOSS OF PRIVACY) RELATED IN ANY WAY TO THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE PRODUCT, EVEN IF SANDISK OR ANY SUPPLIER HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND EVEN IF THE ABOVE REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.  Some states or other jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you.
